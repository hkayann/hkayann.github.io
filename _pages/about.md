## About Me

I am a researcher specializing in **IoT-based anomaly detection, edge AI, adversarial robustness, and embedded ML**. My current focus is on designing **lightweight anomaly detection pipelines** for industrial cyber-physical systems, particularly in **real-time inference on embedded devices** such as **Nicla Sense ME**. 

My research has contributed to **open-source model compression, real-time AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, and robust ML deployments** in constrained environments. I actively work with **TinyML, ONNX, PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite Micro, and edge-to-cloud IoT pipelines**.

I enjoy working with **Linux**, **microcontrollers**, and **edge/fog computing** to develop scalable **ML-powered embedded solutions**.
